Patchwriting: _"copying from a source text and then deleting some words, altering grammatical structures, or plugging in one-for-one synonym-substitutes."_ (Moore-Howards, 1993)

> The first draft of anything is shit.[^EH] The research is the easiest. The outline is the most fun. The first draft is the hardest, because every word of the outline has to be fleshed out.[^KF] A clear sentence is no accident. Very few sentences come out right the first time, or even the third time.[^WZ] People always wonder what kind of superhero power they'd like to have. I want the ability for someone to just open up my brain and take out the entire first draft and lay it down in front of me so I can just focus on the second, third and fourth drafts.[^JB]


> __Indeed,__ writing for me is largely about rewriting.[^KH] 
I love rewriting because that is where and how you discover the story.[^CL] I can't understand how anyone can write without rewriting everything over and over again.[^LT] There is no such thing as good writing, only good rewriting.[^RG] __So,__ it is perfectly okay to write garbage -- as long as you edit brilliantly.[^CJC] __In fact, as__ nothing is said that hasn't been said before,[^T] __and__ nothing is new except arrangement,[^WD] when a thing has been said and said well, have no scruple. Take it and copy it.[^AF] __Remember,__ those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing.[^SD] __And__ through others we become ourselves.[^LV]

― _“Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different.”_ (T.S. Eliot, The Sacred Wood)
